Hello
My name is Chan Wai Man
Chan is my Last name, and Wai Man is my given name
You may call me Raymond or Wai Man, since they are very similar in pronounciation
Some of my friends call me Armin (same as the main character in Attack On titan), which is my nickname
Anyway, nice to meet you there

Moreover, I am an anime lover. I will be so happy if you could recommend some funny anime or comics to me!
